This is the beginning of my journal. I have been exploring Astro as a framework for building my personal site, and so far the experience has been excellent. The content layer API makes it straightforward to manage posts as plain Markdown files while still getting type safety and build-time validation.

Setting up a new project from scratch is always a mix of excitement and tedium. You get to make all the decisions — folder structure, styling approach, deployment pipeline — but you also have to wire everything together before anything actually works. Astro strikes a good balance here by providing just enough structure without being overly prescriptive.

Looking forward to writing more here about things I am building, problems I run into, and ideas worth sharing. If you are reading this, thanks for stopping by.
